## Build 614, 4/20/2025-1:24 AM || Just got project saving and loading done. yay....
...I felt like I had the brain of an ant when making this. Idk how programmers just code through the night like this, my brain is so slow right now. I made the stupidest mistakes making this that made it take so much longer than it should have. I'm typing this at abnormally slow speeds right now, I'm going to bed now.

## Build 614, 4/20/2025-11:07 AM || *A plan.*
I have a plan. My old broken method for pitch shifting was time stretching preserving pitch(currently has a nasty undertone for some reason), pitch shifting via shrinking/stretching sample without preserving pitch, and formant shifting(completly busted...). Instead of trying to fix that, I just realized something existed. ***libESPER;*** a resampler. I can create Hashlink externs for it, and use it to pitch/formant shift the samples. I'm using hashlink externs cause hashlink works across Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Wish me luck..!
