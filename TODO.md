 ### Good job to have gotten this far, future me! Never thought I would get this far! I am so proud of you!! Lets move on to the next set of goals, we're almost done!
 - [ ] Get youtubers to test Solar Synth via email and hope! Repeat this process until a good number of youtubers are happy with it.
 - [ ] Update the version number. (Major.Minor.Patch-BuildNum)
 - [ ] Make a webite via compiling haxeflixel to html5 at resizable quality if haxeflixel supports it. Host it on a new render account.
    - [ ] Main page
        - [ ] Logo/big fancy eye-catching banner
        - [ ] Most recent announcement
        - [ ] Media pages(youtube, discord, twitter/bluesky, etc.)
        - [ ] Describe what Solar Synth is
        - [ ] Describe what Solar Synth can do
        - [ ] Describe what Solar Synth was meant to do/why I made it
    - [ ] Normal docs page on how to use it with videos to help
    - [ ] Getting started page
    - [ ] Plugin docs page
    - [ ] QnA page
    - [ ] Changelog page
    - [ ] Download page
    - [ ] Samples page(video samples)
    - [ ] Voicebanks page
    - [ ] Announcements page
    - [ ] Github repository for said website
    - [ ] A blog page
        - [ ] Funny Development stories with sounds and video snippets
        - [ ] Anything else important
    - [ ] add a link to the github repository to Solar Synth
    - [ ] add a link to the issues page in the Solar Synth repository
    - [ ] Contact page
    - [ ] Find people to help make a few voicebanks that are available for download on the Solar Synth website.
        - [ ] Actually find people for the voicebanks
        - [ ] For file downloading, make another render website, this one will be made in nodejs and it will download a file based on what you requested and close itself after downloading it.
    - [ ] Pin the website second repository to my top repositories on my profile
 - [ ] Make a youtube video announcing its release, documenting what it can do, and using the various voicebanks for a multitude of example songs. Try to get example covers that the youtubers from before had made; But don't release it quite yet, read the next step.
  - [ ] Try to start building a community and establish a release date after the video is done. That way everything will be ready to go when the release date is hit. Make the release date quite far as this is your first time releasing anything that has *this* much potential.
 - [ ] Release Solar Synth if all goes well..!

## Maybes:
  - [ ] *Mayyybe* turn the synthesis engine(or at least the FFT, formant corrector, pitch shifter, and time stretcher) into a library, cause if other people want to use it but have no idea how to make it, they can look at mine. (HUGE MAYBE, I STILL DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO DO THIS.)

## Current Todo:
 - [ ] Make a GitHub repository so I don't lose my progress at all
    - [ ] Make branding and a huge fancy readme with what Solar Synth is, Solar Synths backstory, then what I plan to do with Solar Synth. Then maybe add a hardcoded sample or 2 if audio previews work with GitHub markdown(That last part is optional, cause I'll most-likely run out of gas after typing up the entire readme.)
    - [ ] Pin Solar Synth to my top repositories on my profile
 - [ ] Fix note looping
 - [ ] Add pitch shifting(via time strething preserving pitch, stretching it without pitch preservation to original length, and formant correction)
 - [ ] Take a break from this project when previous tasks are complete.
    - I feel like I deserve this break. I've been working hard on this since mid-march, and I've already gotten this much done within under a month. A whole japanese vocal synthesis engine! SOLO!!! I'm not a huge expensive crazy corporation at all, and I managed to make an entire synthesis engine with 0$ and half of my sanity per day spent. Impressive if I say so myself. Also, I just genuinely need time to work on things that *actually* need to be done irl(especially that one school project.)
    - [ ] Actually take a break for a few days so you don't get burnt out, burn out will be a fr issue. ESPECIALLY when doing the tedious task of editor ui.
    - [ ] Make a hardcoded sample of the synthesis engine using the temporary teto lite voicebank I made in like an hour, then show it to friends and feel good about myself.

## Future Goals:
 - [ ] Make a mod application form
 - [ ] Add build-in multilingual support
 - [ ] Utau support
    - [ ] Ust (shouldn't be that hard..)
    - [ ] Voicebanks (I have to find out how to read an oto.ini and convert samples to work with Solar Synth ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­)
 - [ ] Themes
    - [ ] Custom themes
 - [ ] Reach out to Twindrill to ask if they're down for making a Kasane Teto voicebank for Solar Synth
